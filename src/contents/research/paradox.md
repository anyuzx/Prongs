Hi-C experiments infer the contact probabilities between loci separated by varying genome lengths. Contact probability should decrease as the spatial distance between two loci increases. However, studies comparing Hi-C and FISH data show that in some cases the distance between one pair of loci, with larger Hi-C readout, is paradoxically larger compared to another pair with a smaller value of the contact probability.

We proposed a theoretical framework based on Generalized Rouse Model to solve the FISH-Hi-C paradox, which revealed the heterogeneity of genome organization. The FISH-Hi-C paradox arises because the cell population is highly heterogeneous, which means that a given contact is present in only a fraction of cells. Using an exactly solvable model I constructed a theory, without any adjustable parameters, to extract the distribution of subpopulations from the FISH data, which quantitatively reproduces the Hi-C data.

We applied the theory to the latest experimental measurements and found that the heterogeneity is pervasive in genome organization at all length scales, reï¬‚ecting large cell-to-cell variations.
