How to go from measured contact map to three-dimensional structure of a chromosome is an unsolved problem. Solving such an inverse problem is hard because there is no direct mapping between the contact map and 3D structure due to the heterogeneity of cell populations.

In this work, based on the theory proposed in our [recent study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11897-0), we proved that there exists a theoretical lower bound connecting both the quantities by a simple power-law relation. Hence, the inverse problem - inferring spatial organization from genomic contact map - can be solved approximately even in the presence of conformational heterogeneity. Using simulations, we showed that constructing the distance maps from contact maps could capture the overall organization, justifying the use of the lower bound. Finally, by applying the method combined with various manifold embedding methods to experimental Hi-C data, we were able to visualize the averaged global 3D organization of single chromosome, and also local structures such as Topological Associated Domains (TADs).
