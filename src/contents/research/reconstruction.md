The extensive conformational heterogeneity hinders our ability to infer the 3D structure of chromosomes from population-based Hi-C map. In this study, we proved that there exist a theoretical lower bound to spatial distance and contact probability by a simple power law relation. Hence the inverse engineering problem - inferring spatial organization from Hi-C map - can be solved in approximation in spite of the presence of heterogeneity. Using simulation, we show that the overall organization can be captured by constructing distance map from contact map justifying the use of the lower bound. Finally, by applying our method combined with various manifold embedding methods to experimental Hi-C data, we are able to visualize the averaged global 3D organization of single chromosome and also local structures such as Topological Associated Domains (TADs). In the end, we discuss the limitation of Hi-C map as an ensemble average measurement.
