  description: folding process of copolymer chromosome model

Fingerprints of the three-dimensional organization of genomes have emerged using advances in Hi-C and imaging techniques (see the [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30367165)). However, genome dynamics is poorly understood. We created the chromosome copolymer model by representing chromosomes as a copolymer with two epigenetic loci types corresponding to euchromatin (active) and heterochromatin (inactive). Using novel clustering techniques, we established quantitatively that the simulated contact maps and topologically associating domains (TADs) for chromosomes 5 and 10 and those inferred from Hi-C experiments are in excellent agreement.

Using CCM, we predicted that chromatin exhibits glassy dynamics with coherent motion on micron scale. The broad distribution of the diffusion exponents of the individual loci, which quantitatively agrees with experiments, is suggestive of highly heterogeneous dynamics. This is also reï¬‚ected in the cell-to-cell variations in the contact maps. Finally, the folding process of chromosomes reveals that their organization is hierarchical, involving the formation of chro- mosome droplets (CDs) on genomic scale, coinciding with the TAD size, followed by coalescence of the CDs, reminiscent of Ostwald ripening.
