Nowadays, we know a great deal of the structure of DNA. However, as for the structure of chromosomes, there is still a lot more we don't know than what we do know. Due to the limitation of experimental techniques, it was very difficult to directly visualize the details of how these extremely long macromolecule organize inside the tight space of nucleus. Humans are inherently visual animals, if we cannot visualize something, we have little confident about our knowledge about it. 

Thanks to the recent advances of various experimental techniques, we start to learn more and more about chromosomes. Compared to just 10 years ago, we now can detect millions of millions of physical contacts between chromosome loci and construct a global view of chromosome organization from it, we can also directly look at individual loci moving around inside live cell nucleus in real time.

My main research interest is to look at this problem from a physicist point of view. I develope theoretical and computational models to study the structure and dynamics of chromosomes as well as its connection to the biological function.
