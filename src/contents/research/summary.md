Chromosomes, which are extremely long complexes formed by DNA and proteins, are essential components of heredity. Cellular functions, such as transcription, are determined by the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes and the associated dynamics. Recent exper- imental advances have given impetus to create models that could quantitatively describe the physics of chromosome architecture. With chromosomeâ€™s polymeric nature being a potential determinant of its biophysical property, theoretical and computational models for chromosomes have provided many insights into genome organization. Most of my research work focuses on developing new polymer-physics based theoretical and computational models to investigate the genome organization and dynamics.

Apart from my work on chromosomes, I also studied molecular motors with the eventual of describing how certain motors are dynamically involved in the structures of chromosomes. Molecular motors are proteins, which consume ATP (fuel) to ferry cargo in the cell. They play important roles in many biological processes, such as RNA polymerase that translocate along DNA to transcribe gene, Kinesins or Dyneins in carrying a vesicle along the microtube, Myosin in generating a muscle contraction. I developed a network model for studying multi-motor systems.

These theories and computational models explain experimental results and make predictions on the outcome of future measurements.
