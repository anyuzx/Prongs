  description: multiple molecular motors share a cargo
---

Motors in vivo often work in tandem - multiple motors share cargo of the same kind or even different kind. It is unclear multiple motors work as a team and conﬂicting results of the velocity of the multi-motor system have been reported.

We developed a kinetic model for the coupled a motor system. The chemical ki- netic scheme for a single motor is a one-state model, allowing an analytical solution. The simplicity of the model allowed me to investigate the effects of mechanical coupling between multiple motors on the velocity and force-velocity behavior. Reduction of velocity is predicted for coupled motor system especially when the coupling strength is strong. In addition, we found that multi-motors system is more efﬁcient in transporting large cargo but less efﬁcient in transporting small cargo compared to the single motor. The model is general and could be extended to study cooperation and tug-of-war between motors.
