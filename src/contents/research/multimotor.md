  description: multiple molecular motors share a cargo
---

Molecular motors are proteins which consume ATP to perform work in the cell. They play important roles in many biological processes, such as RNA polymerase in translocating along DNA to transcribe gene, Kinesins or dyneins in carrying a vesicle along the microtube, Myosins in generating a muscle contraction. As much as what we know for a single motor, how do multiple motors work as a team is unclear. In fact, motors in vivo almost always work as teams, i,e a cargo is shared by multiple motors of the same kind or even different kind. In this study, we present a simple kinetic model for studying elastically coupled motor system. We find that multi-motors system is more efficient for transporting large cargo but less efficient for transporting small cargo compared to the single motor. The model presented in this study is general and easy to extend.
