  title: From hi-c contact map to three-dimensional organization of interphase human
    chromosomes
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
  abstract: The probabilities that two loci in chromosomes that are separated by a
    certain genome length can be inferred using chromosome conformation capture method
    and related Hi-C experiments. How to go from such maps to an ensemble of three-dimensional
    structures, which is an important step in understanding the way nature has solved
    the packaging of the hundreds of million base pair chromosomes in tight spaces,
    is an open problem. We created a theory based on polymer physics and the maximum
    entropy principle, leading to the HIPPS (Hi-C-Polymer-Physics-Structures) method
    allows us to go from contact maps to 3D structures. It is difficult to calculate
    the mean distance (&lt;rij&gt;) between loci i and j from the contact probability
    (&lt;pij&gt;) because the contact exists only in a fraction (unknown) of cell
    populations. Despite this massive heterogeneity, we first prove that there is
    a theoretical lower bound connecting &lt;pij&gt; and &lt;rij&gt; via a power-law
    relation. We show, using simulations of a precisely solvable model, that the overall
    organization is accurately captured by constructing the distance map from the
    contact map even when the cell population is heterogeneous, thus justifying the
    use of the lower bound. Building on these results and using the mean distance
    matrix, whose elements are &lt;rij&gt;, we use maximum entropy principle to reconstruct
    the joint distribution of spatial positions of the loci, which creates an ensemble
    of structures for the 23 chromosomes from lymphoblastoid cells. The HIPPS method
    shows that the conformations of a given chromosome are highly heterogeneous even
    in a single cell type. Nevertheless, the differences in the heterogeneity of the
    same chromosome in different cell types (normal as well as cancerous cells) can
    be quantitatively discerned using our theory.Competing Interest StatementThe authors
