Hi, I'm Guang Shi (时光). I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow in [Thirumalai's group](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/thirumalai/home) at the University of Texas at Austin. I work on developing physical models (both theoretical and computational) for living system. Currently, my research focuses on the physical modelling of chromatin folding and molecular motors.

I grew up in Xi'an, China. I received my Bachelor's degree in physics from Nanjing University and got my Ph.D. in biophysics from Univ. of Maryland at College Park. Coming from a physics background, I believe physical modeling of living system can lead to insights and discoveries which are otherwise difficult to be achieved purely by experiments. At the same time, many of _biology_ do lies in the details - an important point computational and theoretical biophysicists should always bear in mind.

My current research focuses on understanding
* [How do the chromosomes fold and move in the confined space of cell nucleus?](/research/#3d-reconstruction-of-chromosomes)
* [The heterogeneity of chromosomes architecture and its role in their biological functions?](/research/#fish-hi-c-paradox)
* [How the molecular motors (such as Kinesins, Myosins, Dyneins et al) work together as teams?](/research/#multi-motor-system)

My research methods are theoretical and computational, involving equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, polymer physics, computer simulations, and machine learning.

Asides from my academic research, I like coding, math, data analysis, and visualization. I occasionally [blog](/posts/) about side projects, interesting problems encountered in my research and other stuff. I previously use a [wordpress blog](https://biophyenvpol.wordpress.com/).

I also love to take [photos](/photos/). I primarily take [films but sometimes digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_versus_film_photography) as well. I currently have a [Nikon F3HP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F3), a [Canon EOS 620](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_650), and a [GR III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricoh_GR_(large_sensor_compact_camera)#Ricoh_GR_III). My favourite photography subject is landscape. It can be either nature or man-made landscape, or [contemporary landscape photography](https://www.google.com/search?q=contemporary+landscape+photography&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwi4yIr9uIbpAhUFeK0KHZ_9Ba8Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=contempolandscape+photography&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgYIABAHEB4yCAgAEAcQBRAeMggIABAIEAcQHlDbK1iKQWD4RmgBcAB4AYABhQKIAd8IkgEFNS4xLjOYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&sclient=img&ei=062lXviSJ4XwtQWf-5f4Cg&bih=1241&biw=2052&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS729US730). My favourite photographers are [Stephen Shore](http://stephenshore.net/index.php) and [Alex Webb](https://www.webbnorriswebb.co/).
