Hi, I'm Guang Shi (时光). I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at University of Texas at Austin. I work on developing physical models (both theoretical and computational) for living system. Currently, my research focuses on the physical modelling of chromatin folding and molecular motors.

I grew up in Xi'an, China. I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics from Nanjing University and got my Ph.D. in biophysics from Univ. of Maryland at College Park. Coming from a physics background, I believe physical modeling of living system can leads to insights and discoveries which are otherwise difficult to be achieved purely by experiments. At the same time, many of 'biology' do lies in the details - an important point computational and theoretical biophysicist should always bear in mind.

Asides from my academic research, I like coding, math, data analysis and visualization. I also love to take photos. I primarily take films but sometimes digital as well.

My current research focuses on understanding
* [How do the chromosomes fold and move in the confined space of cell nucleus?](/research#3d-reconstruction-of-chromosomes)
* [The heterogeneity of chromosomes architecture and its role in their biological functions?](/research#fish-hi-c-paradox)
* [How the molecular motors (such as Kinesins, Myosins, Dyneins et al) work together as teams?](/research#multi-motor-system)

My research methods are theoretical and computational, involving equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, polymer physics, computer simulations and machine learning. Learn more about my research projects at my [research page](/research)
