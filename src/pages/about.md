Hi, I'm Guang Shi (时光). I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow working with Dr. Dave Thirumalai at the Department of Chemistry at The University of Texas at Austin. My research is theoretical and computational biophysics and computational biology, working at the interface of physics, chemistry, machine learning, and biology. I employ sophisticated theories and computational approaches to study the organization, assembly, and dynamics of biomolecules. My methodology is to develop mechanistic models that quantitatively explain the experimental observation while providing useful predictions. My current research interests include the physics of genomes and biomolecular condensates and the physical mechanisms underlying their biological functions.

I grew up in Xi'an, China. I received my Bachelor's degree in physics from Nanjing University. I earned my Ph.D. in Biophysics under the supervision of Prof. Dave Thirumalai from the Biophysics Program at the Institute for Physical Science and Technology, University of Maryland at College Park, in 2019. Subsequently, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin from 2019 to 2021, and at Prof. Kenneth S. Schweizer’s lab in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 2021 to 2023.

Aside from my academic research, I like coding, math, and visualization. I occasionally [blog](/posts/) about side projects, interesting problems encountered in my research, and other stuff. 

I also love to take [photos](/photos/). I primarily take films but sometimes digital as well.
