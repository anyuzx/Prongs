I'm Guang Shi (时光), a Research Associate at the Department of Chemistry, The University of Texas at Austin. I received my Ph.D. in biophysics from University of Maryland, College Park and have worked as postdocs at University of Texas at Austin and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My research sits at the interface of physics, chemistry, machine learning, and biology. I develop both mechanistic and data-driven models to explain and predict how biomolecular systems organize, assemble, and evolve over time.

Current interests include:

- 4D Genome
- Biomolecular Condensates
- Molecular Motors
