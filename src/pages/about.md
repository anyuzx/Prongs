Hi, I'm Guang Shi (时光). I am a postdoctoral researcher at XXX University. I work on developing physical models (both theoretical and computational) to study living system. 

I grew up in Xi'an, China. I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics from Nanjing University and I continued studying Biophysics at Univ. of Maryland at College Park and received the Ph.D. in 2019. Asides from my academic research, I like coding, math and exploring ideas of using machine learning to analyze data. I also love to take photos. I primarily take films but sometimes digital as well.

My current research focuses on understanding
* [How do the chromosomes fold and move in the confined space of cell nucleus?](#)
* [The heterogeneity of chromosomes architecture and its role in their biological functions?](#)
* [How the molecular motors (such as Kinesins, Myosins, Dyneins et al) work together as teams?](#)

My research methods are theoretical and computational, involving equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, polymer physics, computer simulations and machine learning. Learn more about my research projects at my [research page](#)
