Hi, I'm Guang Shi (时光). I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow working with Dr. Kenneth S Schweizer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I work on developing physical models (both theoretical and computational) for living system. Currently, my research focuses on the theoretical and computational study of biomolecular condenstates.

I grew up in Xi'an, China. I received my Bachelor's degree in physics from Nanjing University and got my Ph.D. in Biophysics under supervision of [Dr. D. Thirumalai](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/thirumalai). 

My current research focuses on,
* Theoretical and computational study of biomolecular condensates: microstructure, phase diagram, role of micro-phase separation and its internal dynamics

I have also worked on,
* [The heterogeneity of chromosomes architecture and its role in their biological functions?](/research/#fish-hi-c-paradox)
* [How do the chromosomes fold and move in the confined space of cell nucleus?](/research/#3d-reconstruction-of-chromosomes)
* [How the molecular motors (such as Kinesins, Myosins, Dyneins et al) work together as teams?](/research/#multi-motor-system)

My research methods are theoretical and computational, involving equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, polymer physics, computer simulations, and machine learning.

Asides from my academic research, I like coding, math, data analysis, and visualization. I occasionally [blog](/posts/) about side projects, interesting problems encountered in my research and other stuff. 

I also love to take [photos](/photos/). I primarily take [films but sometimes digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_versus_film_photography) as well. I currently have a [Nikon F3HP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F3), a [Canon EOS 620](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_650), and a GR III. My favourite photography subject is landscape. It can be either nature or man-made landscape, or [contemporary landscape photography](https://www.google.com/search?q=contemporary+landscape+photography&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwi4yIr9uIbpAhUFeK0KHZ_9Ba8Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=contempolandscape+photography&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgYIABAHEB4yCAgAEAcQBRAeMggIABAIEAcQHlDbK1iKQWD4RmgBcAB4AYABhQKIAd8IkgEFNS4xLjOYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&sclient=img&ei=062lXviSJ4XwtQWf-5f4Cg&bih=1241&biw=2052&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS729US730). My favourite photographers are [Stephen Shore](http://stephenshore.net/index.php) and [Alex Webb](https://www.webbnorriswebb.co/).
